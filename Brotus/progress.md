Our team has decided to either use existing FOSS UVdesk 
or create Help Desk from scratch using Python Django


 UPDATE 2 
- Repository of an existing  FOSS was forked ( Python Django ) ;
- Python 3.7 , Django and other packages were installed successfully 
- Unnecessary files were removed 


**Our Team is also considering  working at other FOSS such as **UVdesk** in case project with **Python and Django** does not work as expected**

# UPDATE 3
- Project is being created with Django 
- Models have been created for Question and Answer in Django and settings have been configured 
- Admin panel is  provided by Django
- Basic layout of website has been created 
- Code will be uploaded shortly
